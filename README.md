Hello!

I'm Evan. I'm an engineering student studying at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. I decided to create this account to share my progress through my upcoming years of study. I wanted to express my learning through this account as a way to store and share my experiences with programming languages and concepts.

I plan to specialize in mechatronics, electrical, mechanical or engineering physics second year.

What I'm Learning and what I plan to learn:

- SQL Database
- Data science concepts (Machine learning)
  - Numpy, pandas, tensorflow, etc
- Python advanced concepts
- ReactJS (Front end development)
- Introductory C and C++ Concepts

Goals and clubs/extracurriculars to join:
